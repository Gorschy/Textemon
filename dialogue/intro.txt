======================================
Welcome to the wild world of Textémon!

In this adventure, you are not a Trainer, but a Pokémon itself. This world is filled with breathtaking landscapes, ancient mysteries, friendly allies, and formidable foes.

You've just opened your eyes for the first time in the tall grass of the Viridian Forest. It's a bustling ecosystem filled with different species of Pokémon, each living out their own stories. Today is the day you embark on your own journey.

The world is full of danger and opportunities. Will you spend your days exploring the lush forests and mighty mountains, make friends and form alliances with other Pokémon, or face off against the strongest opponents to prove your might?

The legend tells of a powerful Boss Pokémon who rules over this land. Many Pokémon dream of challenging this mighty creature to earn its respect and take its place. But are you ready for such a challenge? Or will you carve a different path for yourself?

Every decision you make and every encounter you have will shape your destiny. Whether you become a hero, a villain, or something in between, remember one thing: this is your adventure, and you're free to shape it as you wish.

Good luck! The world of Pokémon awaits you!
